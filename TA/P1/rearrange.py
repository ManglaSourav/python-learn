'''
Problem Statement: Given an array of integers A, rearrange A so that all the 0â€™s are
pushed to the end of the array. All other values should stay in the same relative
order. (In O(N))
Examples:
A = [2, 6, 1, 9, 0, 2]
Result: [2, 6, 1, 9, 2, 0]
A = [0, 0, 6, 1, 0, 9, 8]
Result: [6, 1, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0]
A = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
Result: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
