# Youâ€™re given two dataframes: transactions and products.
# The transactions dataframe contains transaction ids, product ids, and the total amount
# of each product sold.
# The products dataframe contains product ids and prices.
# Write a function to return a dataframe containing every transaction with a total
# value of over $100. Include the total value of the transaction as a new column in
# the dataframe.
